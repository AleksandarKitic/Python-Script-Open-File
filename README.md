# Python-Script-Open-File
Script for opening software on the time. We set time in the script when the software open.

We set a time when the software open, working time and when to close software.
This script is in the while loop, we only have to whenever start the script and waiting the time.

We have:
1. Class TurnOnScript:
  2. defs: 
    1.__init__ for def variables
    2.start_project 
  
4 variables:
        self.time_zone
        self.date_time
        self.start_time
        self.end_time
        
1. while loop for working project 
  1-1. if loop when local time is the same like setting time
